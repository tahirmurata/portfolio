                I enjoy working on projects that solve real problems, and am
                proficient in both Japanese and English.
            </p>

            <ul>
                {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
            </ul>
            <p>
                Though I specialize in backend systems, I enjoy crafting clean
                web experiences that emphasize functionality and visual
                harmonyâ€”as demonstrated by this portfolio's design choices.
