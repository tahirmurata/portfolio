            <p>
                I enjoy working on projects that solve real problems and am
                proficient in both Japanese and English.
            </p>
            <h4>Core technical skills</h4>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>
                I'm primarily a backend developer, but I also enjoy creating
                modern, minimalist websitesâ€”just like this one.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
                reading tech blogs, or working on side projects that catch my
                interest.
